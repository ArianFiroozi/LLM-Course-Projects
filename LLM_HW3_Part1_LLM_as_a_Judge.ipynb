Watching some local American shows can somewhat help in getting accustomed to the local accents. While conversing, try to stick to English that's more generic, it might make communication a little easier. When you don't comprehend what is being said, you might want to ask for explanations, though it might not always help. Sometimes, you might be able to guess the meaning of unfamiliar phrases from the situation or conversation. Active listening might be of little help, but it's worth trying. Using translation apps could be an option, but they might not always translate local expressions accurately.\",\n",
              " 'orig_reference_answer': \"The individual can employ a few strategies to improve their understanding and communication in the United States. Here are some of them:\\n\\n1. Familiarize Yourself with the Local Dialect: The first step is to familiarize yourself with the local dialect and accents. This can be done by watching local TV shows, news, or listening to local radio stations. This will help you get used to the accent, pronunciation, and commonly used local expressions.\\n\\n2. Use Standard English: While conversing, use Standard English as much as possible. This will not only help in getting your message across effectively but will also make it easier for the locals to understand you. Avoid using regional specific phrases or expressions that might not be understood in the United States.\\n\\n3. Ask for Clarification: If you don't understand what someone is saying, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Most people would be happy to explain or rephrase their sentences in a way that's easier for you to understand.\\n\\n4. Use Context Clues: Often, the meaning of an unfamiliar word or phrase can be deduced from the context in which it's used. Pay attention to the situation and the conversation to figure out the meaning.\\n\\n5. Practice Active Listening: Active listening involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, responding thoughtfully, and then asking follow-up questions. This can greatly help in understanding local dialects and accents.\\n\\n6. Use Translation Apps: There are various translation apps available that can translate local expressions into your preferred language. This can be helpful when you're struggling to understand something.\\n\\nBy employing these strategies, the individual can effectively improve their comprehension of local dialects, accents, and expressions and can communicate effectively in the United States.\",\n",
